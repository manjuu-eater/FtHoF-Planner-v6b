				<b>Force the Hand of Fate is not completely random, it is based on your game's seed (which changes
					after each ascension) and on the number of spells cast this game. This means that if you know
					the seed then you can predict the results for casting Force the Hand of Fate:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>There are two main things that can affect the result of FtHoF, the current season <s>and the
						golden cookie sound selector</s>. If the season is Valentines or Easter the random seed will
						be
						increased once. This means there are 2 possible results for each cast of FtHoF depending on
						the selected season. Continuing to switch between seasons will not affecting the results,
						they only affect the result at the time the spell is cast.
					</li>
					<li>Dragonflight can also affect the results of casting FtHoF. If the buff is active (not just
						possible) when FtHoF is cast then Click Frenzy is not added to the pool of possible results.
						This can change the result even if the original result was not a Click Frenzy.
					</li>
					<li>Another thing that after the result is how many golden cookies are already on the screen.
						Each one increases the chance of failure by 15%.
					</li>
					<li>Since the result of FtHoF is based on the number of spells cast, if the next FtHoF cookie is
						not the one you want, you can cast a different spell to skip this one. This can be useful if
						you are searching for a particular cookie or need to skip a wrath cookie.
					</li>

				<b>Combo search: Once you import a save file, the planner will display both the earliest and
					shortest versions of combos. Combos are combinations of Building Specials (BS) (and optionally
					Elder Frenzies (EF)) that are close together:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Min combo is the smallest combo to search for; Max is the largest.</li>
					<li>Spread is how much leeway to include in the combo search. For example, if you want a 3x
						combo and are ok with a sequence of [BS, non-BS, BS, BS], that would be a combo size of 3
						with a spread of 1, for a total length of 4.
					</li>
					<li>Include Elder Frenzies is asking whether to count EF spawns from FtHoF in your combos. For
						most people these are just as good, if not better than Building Specials, so they're
						included by default. But in some cases you may not want EF via FtHoF, so I have an option to
						exclude it.
					</li>
					<li>For Skip Abominations and Skip Spontaneous Edifices, see below for more explanation, but
						these options are just asking whether to factor in skippable rows when searching for combos.
						Can't imagine why you'd want this off, but I have the option there at least for educational
						purposes.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

				<b>Gambler's fever dream: Added a column for this, as it's critical to getting combos:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>More chances for Building Special or Elder Frenzy via Gambler's -> FtHoF. Plus these casts
						end up costing significantly less mana, which can help with more spread-out combos. Hover
						over the cookie when it's FtHoF to see what the cookie might contain
					</li>
					<li>Allows for more combos by skipping over certain rows when desired. (Abominations and
						successful Spontaneous Edifice casts from Gambler's can both increment your spell counter
						for free, i.e. without costing any mana.)
					</li>
					<li>For the same skipping reason as above, this can help in incrementing your spell counter
						quickly to get to your desired combo.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Lookahead length: This is how many grimoire casts (rows) are loaded when you import (original had it
				hard-coded to 10).
			</li>
			<li>Spell counter column (the one on the left) now includes indices for both your spells casts this
				ascension, and total spells cast
			</li>
			<li>Building Specials and Elder Frenzies are highlighted yellow</li>
			<li>Rows skippable via Gambler's have their Gambler's spell highlighted blue.</li>

				<b>Cast Spell and Apply Settings:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>The Cast Spell button will forward the whole list 1 spell. It will also apply all settings
						so if you have changed them the outcome for future spells may change. If you have to cast
						FtHoF for a CF first you want to keep that cookie on screen, this way you can up the "Golden
						Cookies on screen" and then cast spell
					</li>
					<li>If you made progress you don't want to click the Import Save button as it will reset your
						manually cast spells. You can use Apply Settings to change stuff up without losing track.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>For early game players the possibility to hide the One change column as they won't have Season
				Switcher
			</li>
			<li>Added a checkbox for the "Supreme Intellect" dragon aura as this should influence the
				positive/negative rate by 10% more negative. This is maybe a bug in the game but currently this
				button is a placebo or a placeholder for future implementation. The game and the planner do
				currently not step out of line when using the aura without any update to the planner.
			</li>

				<b>Random Seed column:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>The Random Seed column shows how much of a backfire chance is required to make a spell backfire. If the random seed is between 0.85 and 1, the spell will backfire with no golden cookies on screen. If the random seed is between 0.7 and 0.85, it will backfire with 1 golden cookies on screen, but it will succeed with 0 golden cookies on screen.
					</li>
					<li>The same random number is used to determine what spell Gambler's Fever Dream chooses. If you have enough magic for any of the 8 spells to be chosen after paying GFD's cost, a random seed that is between 0 and 1/8 will choose the first spell (Conjure Baked Goods), a random seed that is between 1/8 and 2/8 will choose the second spell (FtHoF), and so on. If you don't have enough magic for GFD and half of the price of Spontaneous Edifice, there will only be 7 eligible spells, so a random seed between 0 and 1/7 will give Conjure Baked Goods, a random seed between 1/7 and 2/7 will give FtHoF, and so on. This might interfere with a GFD that says it will give FtHoF, but at a low enough magic amount it might give CBG instead.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The Supreme Intellect checkbox now actually works. Note that Supreme Intellect and Diminish Ineptitude multiply the base 15% backfire chance, and then the 15% increase in backfire chance per on screen GC is added afterward, so a cast with a successful DI, SI active, and 3 on screen GCs would have a 46.65% chance of backfiring, which would mean any spell with a random seed less than 0.5335 would succeed.
			</li>
